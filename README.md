<img src="/planetoid.jpg" width="400">

Another [zero player](https://github.com/eigenhombre/galax#galax)
game involving travel between planetoids.

## Small Goals

- [x] named planetoids / asteroids distributed uniformly between an
  annulus extending from the orbit of Mars to the orbit of Jupiter
- [x] "miners" with names, UPP[1], and initial locations
- [x] acceleration (non-relativistic), turnaround, and deceleration at 1 g
  from original planetoid to destination asteroid.
- [ ] add internal states and goals to miners
- [ ] add strategies towards solving goals, Ã  la [GPS](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/blob/main/docs/chapter4.md#gps-the-general-problem-solver).
