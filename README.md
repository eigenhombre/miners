# Miners

<img src="/planetoid.jpg" width="400">

Some kind of ([zero player](https://github.com/eigenhombre/galax#galax)) game... probably.

## Small Goals

- named planetoids / asteroids distributed uniformly between an
  annulus extending from the orbit of Mars to the orbit of Jupiter
- "miners" with names, UPP[1], and initial locations
- acceleration (non-relativistic), turnaround, and deceleration at 1 g
  from original planetoid to destination asteroid.

[1] Attributes matching a popular, 1980s-era sci fi RPG
